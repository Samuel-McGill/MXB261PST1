# MXB261PST1
This repository contains the code for both parts of the MXB261 Problem Solving Task.
To run Part 1, open MATLAB, change directory into the part1 folder and run part1_main.m. This will generate the four required figures showing the column height distributions for different cases.
To run Part 2, change into the part2 folder and run part2_main.m. This will generate the two required figures showing KL divergence and the comparison of the true vs empirical distributions.
No extra files are needed and everything should run directly in MATLAB.
